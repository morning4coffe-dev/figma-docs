# Export Tab

## Using the Export Tab

The Export tab is another powerful tool to inspect generated code and export to developers.

The left-top dropdown allows you to alternate among `Xaml`, `Colors Override File`, `Fonts Override File` and `Localization File`. Contextual controls at the bottom of the tab allow you to: set view type, refresh view and export the code;

Exporting process is done by adding the tab content to the clipboard, so you can paste it into your favorite text editor.

> Proper generation depends on usage of the proper templates and components, please read the [New design guidelines](../designers/starting-new-design.md) before starting a new project;

### Steps to Use Export Tab

1. Select the page or component to inspect;
2. From Figma's *Plugins* menu select *Uno Platform*;
3. Click the *Export* tab (third one from the left);
4. Click the *Refresh* button at the bottom of the tab.
5. Optional: Change left-top dropdown to `Global Resources` to see the themes resources dictionary. Copy the text there into your Color Override file of your application, as documented in the [Uno Themes documentation](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/external/uno.themes/doc/material-getting-started.html#customize-color-palette).
