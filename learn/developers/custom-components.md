# Custom Components

It is pretty common that apps use third party or custom controls, not present in Winui control library.
For those cases, the plugin allows the user to reserve space in exported layout to those objects.

### Steps to use Custom Components

1. Draw a frame and transform it in a Component;
2. Open the Plugin and select the *Properties Tab*;
3. With your Component selected, active the *Custom Component* toggle;
4. Fill the fields accordingly your Custom Control specifications

> When you add an instance of your custom component in a screen to be generated, the plugin will create the correct Xaml code to your custom control.
