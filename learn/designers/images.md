# Images

## How to Use Images

Images are a key feature in most modern applications. The Uno Figma plugin allows for enhanced flexibility with images in the Toolkit. The use of the Image component from earlier versions of the Toolkit is no longer required: images can be used directly in designs and will be represented in the plugin’s Preview and code tabs.

### Features

* Previewing placed images does not require using Image components, which are now deprecated.
* Plugin preview in actual size.
* Set independent corner radius for each image frame corner.
* Figma’s Fit and Fill modes are supported both in layout preview and XAML generation.

### Guidelines

* Images are represented by placeholders in the plugin’s Preview tab.
* If you are using an older version of the Figma Uno Toolkit, Image components are still supported in the current version of the plugin.
* Figma’s Crop and Tile Image framing modes are not currently supported by the plugin; you may use these functions, but corresponding XAML will not be generated.
* Tip: Place a copy of your images within the Image Export Templates on the Theme page of the toolkit to simplify your exporting workflow.
