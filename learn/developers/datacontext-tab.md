# DataContext Tab

## Using the Data Context Tab

The _Data Context_ tab is basically used to set the `DataContext` for bindings in the [*Preview* tab](preview-tab.md).

The data format is _JSON_.

## Steps to use Data Context tab

1. Select the page or component to edit;
2. From Figma's *Plugins* menu select *Uno Platform*;
3. Click the *Data Context* tab (fourth one from the left);
4. Make changes - follow the JSON format;
5. Click the *Save button* at the bottom of the tab.

> [!NOTE]
> The content of the _Data Context_ is actually set at the _Root Frame_ in Figma. It means no matter which element is currently selected, the data will actually be saved into the first _root_ frame in the Figma data.
