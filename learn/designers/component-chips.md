# How to Use Chips

Chips are used to make selections, filter content, or trigger actions. They can be used alone or appear as a group of interactive elements. It is possible to produce their respective appearances by using the variants of the Chip component.

Chips can be found in the *Assets* panel under the *Basic Input* group of components.

## Steps

1. Drag the *Chip* component into an *Auto Layout* in your design.
2. Select variant options.
3. Duplicate chip instances as needed (drag while holding down the option key OR copy/paste).
4. Launch the Uno plugin and preview the result.
