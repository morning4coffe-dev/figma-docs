# Preview Tab

## Using the Preview Tab

The Preview tab is a powerful tool to troubleshoot your design and spot issues before handoff.

### Preview notes

- Preview is dynamic, you can type into TextInputs, press buttons, and scroll through your design;
- You can even use mock data (DataContext) to better test out your design and see the result bound to data;
- Proper XAML generation depends on usage of the proper templates and components, please read the [New design guidelines](../designers/starting-new-design.md) before starting a new project;
- A contextual control at the bottom of the tab allow you to refresh view;
- Preview does not allow navigation click through at the moment;
- Placed images are not rendered but represented with place holder images of the corresponding dimensions;
- Primitive shapes are not currently supported in preview.
