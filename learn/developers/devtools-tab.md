# Dev Tools Tab

## Using the Dev Tools Tab

> [!NOTE]
> To access this tab, the option `Development` in the Settings tab must be enabled;

The Dev Tools tab allows you to edit and troubleshoot the design before handoff to developers.

The left-top dropdown allows you to alternate among `Xaml Preview`, `Global Resources`, and `Json File`. Contextual controls at the bottom of the tab allow you to: render changes and copy the Xaml code to the pasteboard (these control are only available on the Xaml Preview selection);
