## Uno Toolkit for Figma Document
The starting point is to duplicate the Uno Toolkit for Figma document.

Duplicate the [Uno Platform Material Toolkit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1110792522046146058) from Figma Community.

## Uno Platform Plugin
To start generating XAML from the document, the Uno Platform Plugin is required.

It can be installed directly from the Figma Community using this url: [Uno Platform Figma Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1045528009520465828/Uno-Platform).

## External 3rd party Tools

Some 3rd party tools could be used to improve the experience. However, they are not necessary.

### Atlas Theme Manager Plugin

This is a 3rd party plugin that can be useful to preview light & dark colors directly on Figma canvas.

Here's the link: [Atlas Theme Manager Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/893903420585768458).
