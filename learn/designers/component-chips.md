# Utilizing Chips in Your Design with Uno Figma Toolkit

Chips are versatile components used for selections, filtering content, or triggering actions in a user interface. They can function individually or as a group, providing interactive elements within your design. The Uno Figma Toolkit offers a variety of Chip variants to suit different design needs.

## Locating and Customizing Chips

Chips can be found under the *Basic Input* group in the *Assets* panel of the Uno Figma Toolkit. This section provides access to various styles and functionalities of Chips.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Implement Chips

### 1. Inserting the Chip Component
   - Begin by dragging the *Chip* component from the *Assets* panel.
   - Place it within an *Auto Layout* in your design canvas. This ensures that the Chips are organized and responsive within your layout.

### 2. Choosing Variant
   - Once the Chip is in place, explore the variant options available in the Toolkit.
   - Select the variant that aligns with your design's objective, whether it's for selection, filtering, or action triggering.

### 3. Duplicating Chips
   - To create multiple instances of the selected Chip, duplicate it as needed.
   - You can do this by dragging the Chip while holding down the option key, or by using the copy/paste method.
   - This step is particularly useful when you need a group of Chips for categorizing or filtering content.

### 4. Previewing with Uno Plugin
   - After setting up the Chips, launch the Uno plugin.
   - Use the plugin's preview feature to see how the Chips will appear and interact in your final design.
   - This step is crucial for ensuring that the Chips function as intended and blend seamlessly with other elements of your UI.

By following these steps, you can effectively incorporate Chips into your design, enhancing user interaction and the overall aesthetic of your project. The Uno Figma Toolkit makes it simple to customize and implement these components, ensuring a smooth design-to-code process.
